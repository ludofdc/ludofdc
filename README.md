## Hi there 👋

I work on computational models for physical systems, with a focus on building, solving and validating numerical simulations from first principles.

My main project is a research-oriented thesis on the simulation of electron spill-out from thin metallic slabs, combining density functional theory, partial differential equations and numerical methods.

### Current work
**Simulation of electron spill-out from a thin metallic slab**

- Self-consistent numerical modeling based on DFT
- Discretization and solution of coupled PDEs
- Core solvers implemented in C++
- Data analysis and visualization in Python
- Emphasis on numerical stability, convergence and physical consistency

### Background and goals
Physics background. 
I’m currently learning HTML language and improving my coding skills
Currently seeking a 6-month internship in data, quant or research-oriented roles, followed by a second-level degree.
